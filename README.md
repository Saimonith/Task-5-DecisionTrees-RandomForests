# Task-5-DecisionTrees-RandomForests
"Decision Trees  and random forest using scikit-learn and Graphviz".
## objective
Learn tree-based models for classification& regression using scikit-learn and graphviz.
## steps done
Trained a Decision Tree classifier and visualized the tree
controlled tree depth to avoid overfitting.
Trained a random forest classifier and compared accuracy.
Interpreted feature importances.
Evaluated model using cross-validation.
## Dataset
Used Heart disease dataset
## Tools used
Scikit-learn
Graphviz
pandas , Numpy , Matplotlib
## Results
Decision Tree Accuracy: XX%
Random Forest Accuracy: XX%
Random Forest performed better due to ensemble learning.
